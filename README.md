# Data Analysis with Python

The first step of doing any data science or machine learning project is to get to know your data. In this workshop, you’ll learn how to conduct a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data and important features from a real dataset. Based on exploratory analysis, you’ll also master how to perform data preprocessing and feature engineering.

Are you eager to expand your skill-set in data analysis or just wondering how to get started with your data? Then this workshop is for you!
